AI-Based Image Colorization Using Deep Learning
This repository contains the proposal and future implementation plan for an AI-based image colorization system using deep learning. The aim is to transform black-and-white photographs into vivid, colorized images using a Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

Project Overview
Image colorization brings historical and monochromatic images to life. This project uses deep learning to develop an automated, accurate, and visually realistic solution for restoring black-and-white images. Applications include digital restoration of historical photographs, colorization for documentaries, and creative industries.

Problem Definition
The task is to enhance and restore grayscale images by generating plausible and perceptually accurate color versions. The model will predict pixel-wise color values based on the grayscale input, trained on paired datasets.

Significance and Impact
Enhances the accessibility and engagement of historical media.

Helps in cultural preservation through visual storytelling.

Supports commercial applications in film, art restoration, and creative content generation.

Dataset Description
Source: Kaggle (DIV2K Dataset)

Size: Over 800 high-resolution PNG images

Content: Includes a variety of images—people, animals, landmarks, and landscapes.

Preprocessing Steps:

Cleaning (remove corrupt files)

Normalization (scale pixels to 0–1)

Data augmentation (random rotations, flips)

Dataset Suitability
The DIV2K dataset is diverse and high-resolution, ideal for learning fine-grained color features. It aligns well with the colorization task and supports generalization across various image types.

Generative Model Description
Model: Pix2Pix GAN

A conditional GAN designed for paired image-to-image translation

Learns the mapping from grayscale input to colored output

Architecture:
Generator: Learns to create realistic colorized images

Discriminator: Distinguishes real from generated images, improving output quality through adversarial training

Evaluation Metrics
The model will be evaluated using:

PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) – Measures fidelity to ground truth

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) – Assesses perceptual quality

FID (Frechet Inception Distance) – Compares the distribution of generated vs. real images

Ethical Considerations
Bias: Results may be skewed if the training dataset lacks diversity in object types, scenes, or historical contexts.

Misinformation: Generated colors may misrepresent historical accuracy, especially in cultural or archival contexts.
